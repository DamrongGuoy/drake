# Changes since v1.34.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* Fix `RgbdSensor` image size parameterization crash ([#22065][_#22065])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Move the warning on small-size PSD matrix to each solver backend ([#22136][_#22136])
* [feature] TBD Update single entry of coefficients in LinearCost and QuadraticCost ([#22152][_#22152])
* [feature] TBD Parallelize the Pairwise Set Intersection Checking for GCS (with or without Continuous Revolute Joints) ([#22142][_#22142])  # Note that the parallelism here is used in two ways -- the computation of AABBs of the constituent sets is handled with a parallel for loop, and then the pairwise intersections themselves are checked with SolveInParallel.

New features

* Solve mathematical programs in parallel ([#21957][_#21957])
* Add `CommonSolverOption::to_string` ([#22079][_#22079])
* Introduce `ImplicitGraphOfConvexSets` ([#22074][_#22074])
* Leverage parallelization where possible when checking boundedness of a `ConvexSet` ([#22084][_#22084])
* Set gradient sparsity pattern in `LorentzConeConstraint` and `RotatedLorentzConeConstraint` ([#22125][_#22125])

Fixes

* Throw when `IpoptSolver` options are invalid ([#22062][_#22062])
* Use `GraphOfConvexSetsOptions::preprocessing_solver_options` even if a specific `preprocessing_solver` is not specified ([#22077][_#22077])
* Fix Gurobi console logging to obey our defaults again ([#22108][_#22108])
* Fix bugs where empty `HPolyhedron`'s were reported to be unbounded ([#22117][_#22117])
* Fix the boundedness check of `MinkowskiSum` ([#22084][_#22084]) 
* Fix `GraphOfConvexSets` when passing in a trivially-infeasible upper bound ([#22090][_#22090])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [multibody,geometry] Update parsing infrastructure ([#22102][_#22102])  # 1. MultibodyPlant::RegisterVisualGeometry() can now take a GeometryInstance. - Clean up documentation. - Extend tests to include what is *actually* done. 2. SDF parser makes use of new API. - Stop returning optional<unique_ptr<>> (simply return the unique ptr). - Instead of constructing, deconstructing, and reconstructing geometry instances, we just pass the instance.
* [feature] TBD [geometry] Add precomputed values to VolumeMesh and MeshFieldLinear ([#22097][_#22097])
* [feature] TBD Allow floating bodies to use RpyFloating joints ([#21973][_#21973])  # Also supports using Weld joints instead of floating joints for unattached bodies.
New features

* TBD

Fixes

* Bug fixes for `SapHolonomicCosnstraint` and `SapDriver::AddWeldConstraints()` ([#22057][_#22057])
* Fix `//geometry/proximity:refine_mesh` for cwd-relative paths ([#22106][_#22106])  
* Improve exception message for bad geometry (zero volume mesh) in .obj file ([#21929][_#21929])

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Add Expression Costs and Formula Constraints to Subgraphs in GcsTrajectoryOptimization ([#22091][_#22091])  # Adds placeholder variables to subgraphs, that can be used to construct costs and constraints to each vertex or edge. Note that this includes the fix  Fix a Bug in GCS When Passing in a Trivially-Infeasible Upper Bound #22090, since the conjunctive formula used in a test case creates an instance of this bug.

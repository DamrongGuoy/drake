# Changes since v1.34.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* Fix `RgbdSensor` image size parameterization crash ([#22065][_#22065])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* Solve mathematical programs in parallel ([#21957][_#21957])
* Add `CommonSolverOption::to_string` ([#22079][_#22079])
* Introduce `ImplicitGraphOfConvexSets` ([#22074][_#22074])
* Leverage parallelization where possible when checking boundedness of a `ConvexSet` ([#22084][_#22084])
* Set gradient sparsity pattern in `LorentzConeConstraint` and `RotatedLorentzConeConstraint` ([#22125][_#22125])

Fixes

* Throw when `IpoptSolver` options are invalid ([#22062][_#22062])
* Use `GraphOfConvexSetsOptions::preprocessing_solver_options` even if a specific `preprocessing_solver` is not specified ([#22077][_#22077])
* Fix Gurobi console logging to obey our defaults again ([#22108][_#22108])
* Fix bugs where empty `HPolyhedron`'s were reported to be unbounded ([#22117][_#22117])
* Fix the boundedness check of `MinkowskiSum` ([#22084][_#22084]) 
* Fix `GraphOfConvexSets` when passing in a trivially-infeasible upper bound ([#22090][_#22090])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Bug fixes for holonomic and weld constraints ([#22057][_#22057])  # Fixes wrong frames in the Jacobian computation in SapDriver::AddWeldConstraints(). Fixes usage of variables in constructor of SapHolonomicCosnstraint after they were moved.
* [removal of deprecated] TBD [multibody,systems,geometry] Remove deprecated code 2024-11 ([#22086][_#22086])
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Fix refine_mesh for cwd-relative paths ([#22106][_#22106])  # When the user does 'bazel run :refine_mesh' we should still allow a relative path for input or output. We call chdir here to undo the chdir performed by 'bazel run' into the runfiles tree.
* [fix feature] TBD [multibody,geometry] Improve exception message for bad geometry (zero volume mesh) in .obj file ([#21929][_#21929])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global> Co-Authored-By: Rick Poyner <rick.poyner@tri.global> Co-Authored-By: Sean Curtis <sean.curtis@tri.global>

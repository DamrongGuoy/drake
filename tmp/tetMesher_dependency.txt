Dependency of VegaFEM/libraries/mesher/tetMesher.{h,cpp} under libraries/ directory.

The tetMesher depends on 9 directories (basicAlgorithms/, include/, mesh/ mesher/,
minivector/, objMesh/, performanceCounter/, volumetricMesh/, and windingNumber/) out
of 55 directories in VegaFEM/libraries/.

The tetMesher needs 9 directories, 43 .h files, and 30 .cpp files.

I surveyed this dependency on January 14, 2025 before v4.0.5 (January 22, 2025).
It should still mostly work. However, a few files were moved from include/ to
private/ from the last time I inspected.

My survey on January 14, 2025 missed one #include near the end of triangle.cpp.
At line 373 of triangle.cpp, it has #include "triangle-closestPoint.cpp".
I add it now.

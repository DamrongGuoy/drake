/* Given an input watertight, manifold, self-intersecting-free triangulated
 surface mesh, creates a signed-distance EmPress field, which is defined
 on an embedded tetrahedral mesh enclosing the input surface. The zero-level
 set implicit surface of the EmPress field tracks the original input surface.

 With EmPress, the compliant-hydroelastic contact model can consume an input
 surface mesh directly; users do not need to provide a body-fitted
 tetrahedral mesh.

 In the future, other input representations, e.g. Neural Implicit Signed
 Distance Field, should work too.

 @note   The returned EmPress signed-distance field is generally negative
         inside, zero on, and positive outside the geometry. This sign
         convention follows [Malladi1995] and consistent with the struct
         geometry::SignedDistanceToPoint.

 @param[in] mesh_M   Input watertight, manifold, self-intersecting-free
                     triangulated surface mesh.

 @param[in] grid_resolution  Resolution of the background grid.
 @param[in] out_offset  Include the level-set implicit surface at the
                        +out_offest distance outside the input surface.
                        It is similar to idea of margin.
 @param[in] in_offset   Include the level-set implicit surface at the
                        -in_offset distance inside the input surface.

 @pre both out_offset and in_offset are non-negative numbers.

 @return {mesh_EmPress_M, sdfield_EmPress_M}  The EmPress tetrahedral mesh
                     and the EmPress signed-distance field suitable for
                     hydroelastics. The field makes reference to the mesh.
                     Caller should keep both of them alive together.
